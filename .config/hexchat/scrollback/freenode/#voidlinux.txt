T 1566310196 18<TheAnachron18>	Sadly go is important for me because I use quite a few go tools (daily)
T 1566310249 18<aedinius[w]18>	Oh don't get me wrong, go is pretty neat and seems like a good language.
T 1566310254 18<aedinius[w]18>	It's just weird. ;]

T 1566310326 18<TheAnachron18>	I hope my PR can be merged soon because I need the new lego version

T 1566310364 18<TheAnachron18>	the acme renewal broke on my DNS provider.
T 1566310374 18<TheAnachron18>	and the latest version fixes it.
T 1566310413 18<TheAnachron18>	sadly KDE is taking 90% of the build time these days >.>
T 1566310557 18<john5518>	aedinius[w], I also hear the crack 6 seconds after I do pulseaudio --start
T 1566310566 18<TheAnachron18>	dang, I still have other issues :( no module named pygments
T 1566310605 23*	thePiGrepper (~nagato@132.191.3.3023) has joined
T 1566310660 18<TheAnachron18>	this is weird. seriously. go requires python modules? o.O
T 1566310669 18<john5518>	This is what pulseaudio -v tells me roughly half a second before I hear the crack [pulseaudio] core.c: All sinks and sources are suspended, vacuuming memory
T 1566310702 18<steinex18>	TheAnachron: why would you need to wait on the PR to be merged for that?
T 1566310711 18<john5518>	The crack can also be heard a second or two after running pulseaudio -k
T 1566310719 18<TheAnachron18>	steinex I like to use the official source.
T 1566310728 18<TheAnachron18>	yeah I could build it locally and push it to the VPS too ... you're right
T 1566310809 18<john5518>	The state also changes from (none) to IDLE, then to SUSPENDED
T 1566310811 18<TheAnachron18>	wth. why would it build gtkdoc when I try to build lego? why is this stuff so weird. I dont get it.
T 1566311124 18<TheAnachron18>	ok it seems like when trying to build lego it pulls in git-2.22.0_4 and that needs libglib-devel2.60.5_1 which cant be found. >.>
T 1566311175 18<aedinius[w]18>	make sure you're rebased up the latest?

T 1566311275 18<john5518>	The issue seems to be with module-suspend-on-idle. It said that it will timeout in 5 seconds after pausing the video, which roughly (if we add the previous messages it spews out) equals the 6 seconds I counted.
